# Future-Oriented Organisation
*You explore the organisational context of your project, make business, sustainable and ethical considerations and manage all aspects of the execution of the project.*

In developing the portfolio tool for HighTechXL, I took a made sure that I understand the organizational context of hightechXl, made business considerations, ensured sustainability, addressed ethical considerations, and managed all aspects of project.

### Exploring Organisational Context
During my research, I evaluated the necessity of implementing a portfolio tool at HighTechXL. I assessed various data gathering solutions, focusing specifically on identifying the most suitable option for both HighTechXL and its ventures. This involved an in-depth analysis of HighTechXL's existing data management structure, the type of information they needed to gather, and the tools currently in use.

Business Considerations

Throughout my research, I made multiple business considerations. For example, I considered the cost of tools like Windows Forms and ensured compatibility with PowerBI for effective data visualization. Moreover, I took into account HighTechXL's past experiences with storage solutions when evaluating databases.

During the project, I not only focused on HighTechXL's requirements but also ensured the design of an efficient and user-friendly data input process for ventures. The ventures' decision to use the tool ultimately depended on its usability and effectiveness.

### Sustainable Considerations
Considering the tool's long-term use and scalability within HighTechXL was also an important part of the project. In my research, this translated to phasing out Excel as it would become increasingly difficult to maintain over time.

In my program, I ensured adherence to industry standards and configured my IDE to automatically format my code, check for spelling errors, and enforce coding standards. To enhance code maintainability, I added comments throughout my code and organized files into folders to maintain a clear and structured architecture.

### Ethical Considerations
Ethical considerations were important during development, especially regarding data security and privacy. I prioritized keeping the database data safe. During development, I realized that using only an ID for login could potentially allow it to be guessed, exposing the system to potential attackers who could read or write data inappropriately.

To address this, I implemented part of a login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). I chose this approach because HighTechXL already had a login system in place, and implementing a new one would have been time-consuming. Implementing only the login functionality ensured that I was the only person able to create and distribute login credentials. I also ensured that all credentials had secure passwords and were only provided to authorized testers of the tool.

### Managing Project Execution
Throughout the project, I regularly gathered feedback and adjusted the project scope as needed. I ensured to report my progress during the central meetings at HighTechXL every Monday and proactively sought guidance from the portfolio manager and my company mentor when necessary. I also made sure to keep them up to date on the project.
