# Personal Leadership
*You are entrepreneurial around your projects and personal development, you pay attention to your own learning ability and keep in mind what kind of IT professional and/or what type of positions you aspire to.*


Throughout my internship at HighTechXL, I demonstrated strong personal leadership by taking ownership of key project decisions and actively pursuing my professional development. I made decisions regarding the architecture of the project, including the choice of a database structure and the integration of a specific component library for the front-end, aligning with the best practices and the strategic goals of the "Portfolio Tool". I of course discussed these decisions with my company mentor and the portfolio manager to get their input and feedback.

Moreover, I embraced the challenge of learning new technologies, such as Angular for front-end development and .NET with EF Core for API management, which were already in use by HightechXl, but still new to me.

In addition to enhancing my technical skills, I focused on personal growth through participation in various workshops and events organized by HighTechXL. At the SheCanXL event, I learned valuable communication techniques, including how to deliver a one-minute elevator pitch and the significance of body language. 

I also engaged in the new Tech Cohort, where HighTechXL showcased their newly acquired technologies to potential startups, I also actively participated in brainstorming sessions with ASML talents and the new co-founders, discussing the practical applications of these technologies. 

My involvement extended to representing HighTechXL at the Fontys TechEvent on Strijp S, where I introduced students to HighTechXL and took the opportunity to expand my network by engaging with various companies present at the event.
