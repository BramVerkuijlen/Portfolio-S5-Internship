## Collaboration and Communication
Initially, I used an Agile Scrum methodology for managing the portfolio project, utilizing structures I had used in a previous project (portfolio S3 agile method).

However, as the project evolved, it became clear that the rapidly changing requirements and the fact that I was working solo made the structured Scrum approach less practical. The frequent changes and immediate decision-making did not align well with the structured sprint planning. Therefore, I decided to step away from using a strict Agile methodology.

During the project, I ensured to communicate with my company mentor and the portfolio team, as they were key stakeholders. I also kept the rest of the team updated on the project's progress during the weekly central meetings.

## Code Quality
- I made sure to use company standards and documented the code.
- I conducted multiple user tests throughout the project.
- Conducted a significant user test with several ventures from HighTechXL which can be found [here](https://github.com/BramVerkuijlen/Portfolio-S5-Internship/blob/main/Project/PortfolioTool.md) in the developement process.

## Design and Architecture
- During the project, I created multiple designs for the database and UI design which can be found [here](https://github.com/BramVerkuijlen/Portfolio-S5-Internship/blob/main/Project/PortfolioTool.md) in the developement process.

## Reflection and Learning
- You can see my reflection and learning on the project which can be found [here](https://github.com/BramVerkuijlen/Portfolio-S5-Internship/blob/main/Project/PortfolioTool.md) under Lessons Learned, and of the entire internship [here](https://github.com/BramVerkuijlen/Portfolio-S5-Internship).
