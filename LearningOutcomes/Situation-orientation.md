During my involvement in the project, I applied a range of previously acquired knowledge and skills:

- I used my prior knowledge of front-end development, .NET, and Vue from a previous project to help me with learning and understanding Angular. Angular shares similarities with Vue and some concepts from .NET development, which helped me to learn the framework pretty quickly.

- When developing the API for the project, I used my knowledge of C# and .NET. I have used Entity Framework (EF) in the past for a small application where I only used the auto-generated API calls. The portfolio tool is much more complicated than any of my previous projects, but my previous knowledge of C# and .NET helped a lot during the making of the API.

- Using my experience with databases and SQL, particularly with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (MSSMS), I designed and implemented a robust and scalable database. This project involved both database-first and EF Core's code-first approaches, the latter of which was new to me, demonstrating my ability to adapt and learn new methodologies.

- Initially, I attempted to implement an Agile workflow using Jira as a task board. However, due to rapidly changing requirements and HighTechXLs workflow, the structured Scrum approach became less practical over time. I adjusted my approach to better fit the project's dynamics, moving away from strict Agile methodologies.

- For version control, I employed Git with a straightforward branching strategy optimized for solo development that I had already been using multiple times for earlier projects. The master branch served as the stable build branch, ensuring that it remained reliable and ready for production at all times.
