# Targeted Interaction
*You determine which partners play a role in your project, collaborate constructively with them and communicate appropriately to achieve the desired impact.*

During my internship at HighTechXL, effective collaboration and targeted communication were pivotal in achieving the project's goals. I frequently engaged with a diverse group of stakeholders, including my supervisor, the portfolio manager, and another intern taht was doing his internship on portfolio management. Furthermore, I proactively sought feedback from my colleagues and other interns and I made multiple proof of concept build to gather feedback on the project. Additionally, I participated in HighTechXLâ€™s weekly meetings, which kept the team updated on my progress and allowed me to stay informed about other projects within the organization.

Although I initially attempted to implement an agile workflow using Jira to manage my tasks efficiently, frequent events, changes, and the solo nature of my work made it challenging to maintain this workflow. Ultimately, I decided to discontinue the structured agile approach in favor of a more flexible, adaptive method better suited for the project.
