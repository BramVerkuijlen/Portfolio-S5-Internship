# Portfolio Tool

***
## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this project is to develop the "Portfolio Tool" during my internship at HighTechXL. As a software engineering student, my goal is to automate and standardize the collection of quarterly updates from startups, which has traditionally been handled manually through emails and phone calls. This manual process often resulted in inconsistent and sometimes incomplete data, complicating the task of maintaining an up-to-date and clear view of each startup's progress within the HighTechXL ecosystem. Such inconsistencies also hindered HighTechXL's ability to provide necessary data to potential investors.

The Portfolio Tool is designed to replace these outdated manual communications with an automated, standardized system that ensures data consistency and quality. Additionally, the tool addresses the crucial need for effective information storage, enabling HighTechXL to maintain a robust database of venture updates that can be easily accessed and managed. This enhancement will facilitate better support and resources allocation within the HighTechXL ecosystem.

### Role
As the main developer of the Portfolio Tool, I was responsible for all aspects of its development, from design and architecture to database creation and integration. My tasks included:

  Design and Architecture: I handled the comprehensive design and architectural setup, ensuring the tool was functional and efficient.
  Database Creation: I developed the database that supports the tool, focusing on scalability and ease of data management.
  Guidance and Collaboration: I worked closely with the current portfolio manager to understand the requirements and nuances of portfolio data collection. This collaboration was crucial in shaping the toolâ€™s functionality.
  Software Development: Alongside the software team, which consisted of my supervisor, I integrated the new tool with the existing Venture Journey Tool to enhance its capabilities and ensure seamless operation.

This role provided me with significant hands-on experience in managing a full-cycle development project, honing my technical skills and understanding of effective team collaboration.

### Technology Stack

The development of the Portfolio Tool involved using a blend of technologies that were already familiar within HighTechXL.

- **Frontend**: The frontend of the application was developed using AngularJS and TypeScript, a choice driven by its existing use within HighTechXL. This provided a consistent framework that aligns with other projects and applications within the organization.
  Material Components were integrated for styling, enhancing the user interface with a modern and responsive design and making fornt-end developement more time efficient.

- **Backend**: The backend functionality was built using a C# API with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) for managing the database interactions. This setup enabled a robust "code first" approach, allowing for an agile development process where changes in the database schema could be managed directly through the codebase.

- **Database**: A standard SQL database was chosen for its simplicity and ease of use, particularly given the requirements for compatibility with my personal development setup. SQL databases are well-known for their reliability and broad support, making them an ideal choice for the data management needs of this tool.

Further technical and strategic justifications for choosing this specific technology stack and the design of the web application over alternatives such as a form builder are detailed in my research document ["How can HighTechXL implement an information management system that efficiently stores, and easily retrieves startup data to optimize the support processes?"](https://github.com/BramVerkuijlen/Portfolio-S5-Internship/blob/main/research/How%20can%20HighTechXL%20implement%20an%20information%20management%20system%20that%20efficiently%20stores%2C%20and%20easily%20retrieves%20startup%20data%20to%20optimize%20the%20support%20processes%3F.md). This research gives more insight on some of the technological decisions made.
