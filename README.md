## Intro

## What is HighTechXL
***
HighTechXL is a deep-tech venture builder that creates deep-tech businesses to solve big societal problems. 
They bring together technology, top talent, and business knowledge in a program that helps these teams grow. 
Using their ecosystem, HighTechXL connects ventures with the resources, advice, and customers they need to become a successful ground breaking business.

## Current situation
***
HighTexhXl would like to receive a status update every quarter. 
Currently, the process for collecting quarterly updates from startups is manual, relying on emails and phone calls. 
This approach has resulted in inconsistent and sometimes incomplete data, making it challenging to get an accurate and comprehensive overview of each startup's progress.

## The assignment
***
As part of my role at HighTechXL, I'm developing a **Portfolio Tool** to streamline and standardize the quarterly updates from startups. 
This tool aims to replace outdated manual communications with an automated, standardized system, enhancing data consistency, quality, and analysis capabilities.
