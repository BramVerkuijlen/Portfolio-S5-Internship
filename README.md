## Introduction

My name is Bram Verkuijlen, a 20-year-old software engineering student at Fontys ICT Eindhoven. As part of my fifth semester, I am undertaking an internship at HighTechXL, a deep-tech venture builder that focuses on creating technological solutions for significant societal issues. During this internship, I am tasked with developing a "Portfolio Tool" aimed at automating and standardizing the quarterly updates from startups.

This portfolio provides a detailed overview of my internship experience. It includes the research and design phases, the challenges encountered along the way, and my personal growth as I applied and expanded my software engineering skills in a dynamic business environment.

## What is [HighTechXL](https://hightechxl.com/)
HighTechXL is a deep-tech venture builder that creates deep-tech businesses to solve big societal problems. 
They bring together technology, top talent, and business knowledge in a program that helps these teams grow. 
Using their ecosystem, HighTechXL connects ventures with the resources, advice, and customers they need to become a successful ground breaking business.

***
## The assignment
HighTechXl would like to receive a status update from a venture every quarter. 
Currently, the process for collecting quarterly updates from ventures is manual, relying on emails and phone calls. 
This approach has resulted in inconsistent and sometimes incomplete data, making it challenging to get an accurate and comprehensive overview of each startup's progress.

As part of my role at HighTechXL, I'm developing a **Portfolio Tool** to streamline and standardize the quarterly updates from startups. 
This tool aims to replace outdated manual communications with an automated, standardized system, enhancing data consistency, quality, and analysis capabilities.
