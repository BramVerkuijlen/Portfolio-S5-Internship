## Introduction

My name is Bram Verkuijlen, a 20-year-old software engineering student at Fontys ICT Eindhoven. As part of my fifth semester, I am undertaking an internship at HighTechXL, a deep-tech venture builder that focuses on creating technological solutions for significant societal issues. During this internship, I am tasked with developing a "Portfolio Tool" aimed at automating and standardizing the quarterly updates from startups.

This portfolio provides a detailed overview of my internship experience. It includes the research and design phases, the challenges encountered along the way, and my personal growth as I applied and expanded my software engineering skills in a dynamic business environment.

## What is [HighTechXL](https://hightechxl.com/)
HighTechXL is a deep-tech venture builder that creates deep-tech businesses to solve big societal problems. 
They bring together technology, top talent, and business knowledge in a program that helps these teams grow. 
Using their ecosystem, HighTechXL connects ventures with the resources, advice, and customers they need to become a successful ground breaking business.

***
## The assignment
HighTechXl would like to receive a status update from a venture every quarter. 
Currently, the process for collecting quarterly updates from ventures is manual, relying on emails and phone calls. 
This approach has resulted in inconsistent and sometimes incomplete data, making it challenging to get an accurate and comprehensive overview of each startup's progress.

As part of my role at HighTechXL, I'm developing a **Portfolio Tool** to streamline and standardize the quarterly updates from startups. 
This tool aims to replace outdated manual communications with an automated, standardized system, enhancing data consistency, quality, and analysis capabilities.

## Personal Reflection

### Software Growth
During this project, I significantly enhanced my technical skills. Learning Angular was a major focus, and despite initial challenges with its injection system and subscriptions, my experience with Vue.js and .NET helped me quickly adapt. Customizing existing components using Preline and Flowbite improved my understanding of Tailwind CSS and HTML.

I also delved deeper into EF Core, exploring both database-first and code-first approaches, and found the code-first approach more suitable. Working on a larger-scale project enhanced my understanding of EF Core's database interactions. Additionally, I implemented a JWT-based login system, a new skill for me.

Through my research, I expanded my knowledge of form builders, Power BI, and temporal tables, which, while not used in this project, could be valuable for future endeavors.

### Soft Skills
Throughout the project, I also learned a lot about HighTechXL, venture building, and the HighTechXL ecosystem. HighTechXL often hosted events for their ventures and others interested in tech and venture building. These events significantly improved my communication skills, especially through workshops related to the project. For example, during SheCanXL, I attended a workshop on pitchingâ€”not just pitching an idea but pitching yourselfâ€”which aligned with a workshop on body language held during the same event.

I also improved my problem-solving skills by finding solutions to multiple issues, such as the login system. This experience made me more resourceful and effective in tackling technical challenges.

### What went well

HighTechXL is a very diverse company with people coming from all over the world, making English the primary spoken language. During the project, I managed to adapt quickly to HighTechXL's environment and the diverse group of people within and around the company.

Although I had prior experience with .NET C# and Vue.js, Angular was completely new to me, and I had very little experience with EF Core. However, I managed to learn Angular and EF Core pretty quickly during the project.

I managed to work independently throughout the project while making sure that I still recieved enough feedback, stayed in touch with my stakeholders enough, that both my stakeholders and company mentor were kept up to date regarding the project's progress.

### What could have gone better

In the first half of the internship, I did not communicate enough with my company mentor regarding school because I did not think that HighTechXL and my mentor would be interested in what was going on with the school side of the internship. During the mid-term assessment, I received feedback from my company mentor that while I communicated well about my project work and progress, I did not provide much information on my progress regarding school. After this feedback, I made sure to provide regular updates to my mentor on both my school progress and the project's development for the rest of the internship.
