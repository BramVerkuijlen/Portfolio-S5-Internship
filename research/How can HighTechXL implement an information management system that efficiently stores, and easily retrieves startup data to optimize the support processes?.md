## Introduction

HighTechXL is facing significant challenges in keeping pace with its data management demands during its rapid expansion. The organization's dependency on a large Excel file for storing crucial data about the startups it supports has become increasingly problematic. What once was an efficient system has now become unwieldy due to fast-paced growth, resulting in a file cluttered with outdated information and a slow, error-prone manual update process.

The manual updating of the master file, requiring data extraction and input from various sources like presentations and phone calls, is both time-consuming and susceptible to errors. This approach to data management is proving unsustainable for an organization experiencing rapid growth.

While the use of PowerBI for communicating with investors does offer structured and visually appealing data presentations, it also brings to light additional challenges. One major issue is finding the correct fields within the database, as some may be outdated, making it difficult to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the data presented. Another challenge is fitting all necessary information onto a page, given that the Excel file does not limit the size of a data field, which can complicate the presentation and interpretation of data in PowerBI.

These issues underscore the urgent need for HighTechXL to adopt a more advanced information management solution. The current system's limitations, including difficulties with using PowerBI effectively due to outdated fields and the unwieldy nature of the Excel database, highlight the necessity for a streamlined and efficient approach to data management to support the organization's continued growth.
